# Optical-Character-Recognition-Engine
Using Python libraries such as, Neurolab & Numpy, along with Stanford's OCR dataset, I was able to built an engine that recognizes written characters. 

This is an Artificial Neural Network that uses Optical Character Recongition. OCR is the process
of recongizing hand written characters in images. I have also coded a character visualization python file, 
in order to see the images from the data set (attached above). 
The visualization engine was done by using the OS, SYS, OpenCV and Numpy libraries in Python (Once you run it, click space bar to see more images).
